Install numpy, matplotlib, scipy and jupyter notebook if not already have them

Open the program in jupyter notebook for file with .ipynb extension, or using Linux for .py extension
 
The program is to solve and plot the Lorenz Graph for input r value from user

The graph will show the chaotic state of data being taken out and put back which creates small holes and fragmented the data with:

Set x0, y0, z0 as file size with (0.512 MB, 0.256 MB, 0.512 MB)

 x, y, and z axis represents the value of chaotic state of the system when data is swapped in and out of the system, creating holes that causes fragment and deletion of file.



Run the program on Jupyter notebook or Linux


After executing, the graph will show
